## Assessment by Category

### 1. Code Structure & Organization

**Current State: ðŸ”´ Needs Improvement**

#### Issues Identified:
- **Monolithic server.ts**: 150+ lines with all routes defined inline
- **Database connection anti-pattern**: New connection created per request
- **No dependency injection**: Services instantiated inline in routes
- **Mixed concerns**: Business logic mixed with HTTP handling
- **Hardcoded configuration**: Database paths and other config hardcoded

#### Impact: High
- Makes the application difficult to test, maintain, and scale
- Creates performance bottlenecks and resource leaks
- Reduces code reusability and increases coupling

#### Recommendations:
1. **Extract route handlers** into separate modules (`src/routes/`)
2. **Implement dependency injection** container
3. **Create singleton DbService** with connection pooling
4. **Externalize configuration** using environment variables

### 2. Performance & Scalability

**Current State: ðŸ”´ Needs Improvement**

#### Issues Identified:
- **Inefficient database connections**: New connection per request
- **No connection pooling**: Resource waste and connection overhead
- **Synchronous operations**: Blocking operations in async contexts
- **No caching layer**: Repeated database queries for same data
- **Missing pagination**: Collections could grow unbounded

#### Impact: High
- Poor performance under load
- Resource exhaustion with multiple concurrent users
- Scalability bottlenecks

#### Recommendations:
1. **Implement connection pooling** with sqlite connection reuse
2. **Add Redis caching** for frequently accessed data
3. **Implement pagination** for collections and feeds
4. **Add database indexing** for query optimization
5. **Consider read replicas** for scaling read operations

### 3. Security Architecture

**Current State: ðŸŸ¡ Developing**

#### Current Security Features:
- Basic rate limiting (100 requests/15 minutes)
- Express body parser with JSON type restrictions

#### Issues Identified:
- **Missing HTTP signatures**: Critical for ActivityPub federation security
- **No input validation**: Raw user input passed to database
- **Missing security headers**: No CORS, CSP, or other security headers
- **No authentication middleware**: No user authentication system
- **Hardcoded secrets**: No secret management system

#### Impact: High
- Vulnerable to various attacks (injection, XSS, etc.)
- Cannot properly federate with other ActivityPub instances
- No way to verify activity authenticity

#### Recommendations:
1. **Implement HTTP signatures** for activity verification
2. **Add input validation middleware** using libraries like Joi or express-validator
3. **Add security headers** middleware (helmet.js)
4. **Implement proper authentication** system
5. **Add environment-based secret management**

### 4. Testing Architecture

**Current State: ðŸ”´ Critical Gap**

#### Current State:
- **Test Coverage**: Only 12/65 tests passing (53 skipped)
- **Test Types**: Unit tests only, no integration tests
- **CI Integration**: Tests run in GitHub Actions but most are skipped

#### Issues Identified:
- **Skipped tests**: 81% of tests are currently skipped
- **No integration tests**: API endpoints not tested end-to-end
- **No test database**: Tests may interfere with each other
- **Missing test utilities**: No test fixtures or helpers
- **No performance tests**: No load or stress testing

#### Impact: Critical
- Cannot confidently deploy changes
- High risk of introducing bugs
- Difficult to maintain code quality

#### Recommendations:
1. **Un-skip and fix existing tests** as immediate priority
2. **Add integration tests** for all API endpoints
3. **Implement test database** with proper isolation
4. **Add test coverage reporting** and enforce minimum thresholds
5. **Create test utilities** and fixtures for common scenarios

### 5. Observability & Monitoring

**Current State: ðŸŸ¡ Basic**

#### Current Features:
- Basic console logging for requests and responses
- Error logging to console

#### Issues Identified:
- **No structured logging**: Plain console.log statements
- **No log levels**: All logs at same level
- **No metrics collection**: No business or technical metrics
- **No health checks**: No endpoint for service health monitoring
- **No error tracking**: No centralized error reporting

#### Impact: Medium
- Difficult to troubleshoot production issues
- No visibility into application performance
- Cannot proactively identify issues

#### Recommendations:
1. **Implement structured logging** with Winston or similar
2. **Add health check endpoints** for monitoring
3. **Implement metrics collection** with Prometheus/StatsD
4. **Add error tracking** service integration
5. **Create monitoring dashboard** for key metrics

### 6. Documentation & Knowledge Sharing

**Current State: ðŸ”´ Significant Gaps**

#### Current Documentation:
- ROADMAP.md exists with good technical debt identification
- Inline code comments are minimal
- TypeScript provides some self-documentation

#### Issues Identified:
- **No README.md**: Missing project overview and setup instructions
- **No API documentation**: Endpoints not documented
- **No contributing guide**: No development setup instructions
- **No deployment guide**: No production deployment instructions
- **Missing ADRs**: No architectural decision records

#### Impact: High
